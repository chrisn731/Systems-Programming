    #define N 10;

Answer: Defines dont need semicolons.

1. (2pts.)
Suppose you defined the macro
    #define SIX 2+4

    Then, suppose you used it in another expression:
       int x = 12 / SIX;

    What value would x be set to?

Answer: The preprocessor would write (int x = 12 / 2+4) and through order of 
	operations, the answer x would be is 10.

2. (4pts.)
Write your own version of atoi:
    Take a char, inspect its numeric value and return its corresponding int value:
    (do not use atoi() or any other automatic conversion function)
        e.g.
            int test = my_atoiChar('5');
            if( test == 5 )
            {
                return 0;
            }
            else
            {
                return -1;
            }
Answer:
	int my_atoiChar(char c)
	{
		return (c - 48);
	}

Using my_atoi, expand it to convert a string representing an integer in to an integer.
Take a string of any length, scan its chars until you hit the '\0' and return the entire string's int value:
(do not use atoi() or any other automatic conversion function)
    e.g.
        int test = my_atoiString("512");
        if( test == 512 )
        {
            return 0;
        }
        else
        {
            return -1;
        }
Answer:
	int my_aotiString(char *str)
	{
		int total = 0;
		int multiplier = 1;
		char *parse = str;
		
		while (*parse != '\0') {
			parse++;
		}
		while (str != parse) {
			parse--;
			total += my_atoiChar(*parse) * multiplier;
			multiplier *= 10;
		}
		return total;
	}
